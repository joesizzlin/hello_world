Following New User Guide

I am fairly new to programming and familiar to basic concepts.
I took is upon myself to learn a bit more about he software develpment world.
A friend recommended that I create a github account and dive into some work.
Currently, I spend a majority of my time going through some C++ literature and practice code through VS
Hopefully I will have some more useful things to add to my account in the near future.
I also have some Arduino and R experince through college and personal projects
My full-time career is in the prosthetics field, primarally on the clinical side,
  but I've always taken a large interest in research and devolopment. Also including clinical research.
Thanks all!
